Defining an energy network
==========================

An energy network can be defined as an object of the EnergyNetworkIndiv class or the EnergyNetworkGroup class. This
object then acts as the primary container for the model. An energy network is grouped into buildings, each building would
then contain the definition of components such as sources, sinks, transformers, and buses (the connections between
different components). These components, and their respective parameters, are defined in an excel file which is provided
as an input. A description on how to prepare the excel file is provided in the next sections.

EnergyNetworkClass
------------------
The EnergyNetworkClass is the main parent class, from which two child classes EnergyNetworkIndiv and EnergyNetworkGroup
are inherited. Either EnergyNetworkIndiv class or EnergyNetworkGroup class could be used to define an energy network.
The choice mainly depends on whether the buildings are linked together (electrically and/or thermally) or not.

If the buildings within an energy network do not share electricity and/or heat, EnergyNetworkIndiv class is used::

    import EnergyNetworkIndiv
    network = EnergyNetworkIndiv(dateTimeIndex)

Otherwise, if the buildings are expected to share energy (electrical and/or heat), EnergyNetworkGroup class is used::

    import EnergyNetworkGroup
    network = EnergyNetworkGroup(dateTimeIndex)

The parameter to be passed in both the cases is a Datetime index. This parameter gives the time range for an
optimization model. The Datetime index could be defined using date_range() in pandas::

    import pandas as pd
    dateTimeIndex = pd.date_range('2021-01-01 00:00:00', '2021-12-31 23:00:00', freq="60min")

The scenario consisting of the energy network (including buildings and links, if any) to be optimized can be defined using either a configuration (or config) file or an excel file. The input config/excel file define the available energy conversion and storage technologies. The associated parameters and sizing limits of the technologies are also defined within the input scenario file, along with the cost and environmental impact assumptions per technology, a path to the demand profiles and weather data files. The purchased electricity cost as well as the emissions of the grid electricity can either be a time series or a constant value. The demand profiles for space heating can be defined statically or alternatively by means of a dynamic linear building model. After preparing the config/excel file, an energy network can be defined in a Python script for optimization.

Descriptions of input excel/config files are given next.


Input Excel File
----------------
Once the ``network`` object has been created, a model can be built from an input excel file which
defines different components which constitute the model, how they are connected and their associated parameters::

    network.setFromExcel(inputExcelFilePath, numberOfBuildings, clusterSize, opt, mergeLinkBuses, dispatchMode)

``inputExcelFilePath`` gives the path of the excel input file. ``numberofBuildings`` is an integer parameter specifying the
number of buildings defined in the excel file. The last two parameters clusterSize and opt are optional. The ``opt``
parameter could be either ``'costs'`` (default value) or ``'env'`` depending on which criteria should be optimized. The ``mergeLinkBuses`` parameter is an optional argument whether or not to use the merge of the different buses (set as False if not given). The ``dispatchMode`` parameter is an optional argument whether or not to activate the dispatch optimization (set to False if not given). The
``clusterSize`` parameter is used to provide a selected number of days which could be assumed representative of the entire
time range. For example: two typical days could be selected to model the entire year, which could represent two clusters
summer and winter. This would improve the optimization speed. If not given during the function call, the default value
of the clusterSize parameter assumes no day clusters. This parameter is described further in
:ref:`advanced_under_development_features`

The input excel file is used to define an optimization model and set the model parameters. Each sheet of this excel file
is structured to defin different components, such as buses, storages and transformers, their respective parameters,
connections between these components and the building to which they belong.

      :alt: input_excel_info

A sample excel file for building the energy network model is given in the excels folder: `scenario.xls <https://github.com/SPF-OST/optihood/blob/main/data/excels/scenario.xls>`_.
The input excel file typically has 9-10 sheets, each defining a different component type of the model.

buses
^^^^^
This excel sheet defines the buses used in the energy network. Buses define the connections between different
components. Each row of this excel sheet represents a bus node in the model.

.. image:: ./resources/input_excel_buses.png
      :width: 400
      :alt: input_excel_buses

``label`` (string)
    label name of the bus. Should be unique for each building i.e. different buildings could have the same label for two
    buses but for one building the buses should not have duplicate labels.

``active`` (0 or 1)
    If set to 1 then the corresponding bus is active, otherwise (if 0) then the bus is inactive in the model. Could be
    used to optimize different scenarios with different buses without the need to re-construct the base excel file.

``excess`` (0 or 1)
    If set to 1 then the corresponding bus has the possibility of having an excess flow unbalanced to the demand. An
    additional sink node is automatically added in this case to accept this excess flow. If set to 0 then the bus cannot
    have an excess flow.

``excess costs`` (float)
    The associated cost of excess flow from a bus. Relevant only if ``excess`` is set to 1. Could be negative to denote
    monetary gains such as in case of PV feed-in.

``building`` (integer)
    Building number to which the bus belongs. Should be unique for each building.

commodity_sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This sheet defines the different commodity sources which serve as an energy input to the model. The parameters ``label``,
``active`` and ``building`` are analogous to the parameters described earlier for buses.

    CO2 impact per kW of the commodity source.

``variable costs`` and ``CO2 impact`` could be either constant value (float) or a path to a CSV file containing cost/impact data.

    Label of the bus from which the energy flows to the demand node. The corresponding bus label should exist in
    the buses sheet.

``fixed`` (0 or 1)
    If set to 1, the energy demand profiles are fixed and a path to the demand profiles should then be given in the
    csv_data sheet of the input excel file. If set to 0, the optimizer will select the demand profiles for optimum
    operation (a total annual demand profile could be given in this case). At the present development stage only fixed
    demands are accepted.

``nominal value`` (float)
    The demand profiles series should be normalized values. this parameter then defines the maximum demand with which
    the normalized series is multiplied to obtain the actual demand profile series. If set to 1, then the given demand
    profile series is taken as it is (not normalized).

``building model`` (string)
    If set to 'Yes', the custom sink component for building RC model would be used instead of static demand profiles. This
    is an under-development feature described further in :ref:`advanced_under_development_features`, do not set this column
    to 'Yes'. Leave this column blank if building model should not be used.

    Set as 0 if this cost is to be ignored.

``installation`` (float)
    Installation cost of the node. Given as a percentage of the base investment cost ``invest_base``. For example:
    if the Installation cost is to be taken as 15% of ``invest_base``, then ``installation`` field should be 0.15. Set
    as 0 if this cost is to be ignored.

``planification`` (float)
    Cost associated with planning. Given as a percentage of the base investment cost ``invest_base``. For example:

have been used to linearize the thermal hot water storage. The parameter names used here are similar to the parameters
defined in oemof-thermal.

links
^^^^^

This excel sheet defines the parameters for electricity and space heating links. The buildings could share electricity
production and/or space heat production. Links allow this sharing to be possible. ``label`` and ``active`` have been
defined already for buses excel sheet. ``invest_base`` and ``invest_cap`` parameters (defined in the transformers sheet

.. image:: ./resources/scenario_profiles_new.png
      :width: 400
      :alt: scenario_profiles_new

grid_connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This excel sheet should not be modified by the users. It defines the separation of the flows from electricity grid and
the produced electricity flows to make sure that the grid electricity is not stored in batteries.

Input Config File
----------------
The config file was introduced to make the scenario definition more intuitive and less prone to errors. The config file, therefore, can be used
as an alternative way of formulating an optimization problem.

In a config file, one could provide the same information as in the input Excel file but for a case where all
the buildings have an identical setup (technologies, limits on capacities, costs, etc.).

.. image:: ./resources/config_file.png
      :width: 500
      :alt: config_file_example

Each building would have the same available energy sources and technologies. Paths to the weather file, electricity impact and demand profiles are also
specified within this config file. Moreover, the connections between energy sources, conversion and storage technologies and demands are fixed to default system connections when a config file is used. Those conncections are illustrated on the Figure below. 

.. image:: ./resources/config_file_fixed_connections.png
      :width: 500
      :alt: Default connections between different system components when a config file is used for optimization problem definition

Note that the specific connections would realize only when the corresponding technologies/sources/sinks are
selected. As an example, the connection between natural gas resource and CHP would be realized only if the
optimizer chooses CHP as an optimum solution in the optimization results.  All the different parameters have already been described for the excel files.

A new method called ``createScenarioFile()`` was implemented within the EnergyNetworkIndiv
and EnergyNetworkGroup classes. This function reads a config file and derives the equivalent Excel file based
on the default system component connections::

    network.createScenarioFile(configFilePath, excelFilePath, numberOfBuildings)

``configFilePath`` is the path to the config file describing the components of the model, ``excelFilePath`` gives the path for the excel output file. ``numberofBuildings`` is an integer parameter specifying the
number of buildings defined in the config file.

The equivalent Excel file includes the same energy sources,conversion and storage technologies (including same costs, minimum/maximum capacities, etc.) for each
building. It is worthwhile to note that the ``createScenarioFile()`` could still be used to prepare a first
version of the Excel file if system components for all the buildings are not identical. The prepared Excel file
could then be adapted later on instead of creating it from scratch.
